The concept outlined is valid because it uses an Actor-Critic approach, which is well-suited for problems where both the state space and the action space are complex and potentially continuous, as can be the case with NoC system optimization. In this framework, the 'actor' learns to choose the best action given the current state (like adjusting NoC parameters), and the 'critic' estimates the value of the state-action pair (feedback on NoC performance). This dual mechanism allows for more robust learning because the critic helps to reduce the variance of the updates applied to the actor, leading to a more stable and steady convergence. 

Additionally, the design includes a simulator environment, which is crucial for reinforcement learning as it allows the model to interact with a representation of the NoC, gaining experience and improving over time without the risk of impacting an actual physical system during the learning phase. 

The implementation details, such as using a neural network model and an Adam optimizer for training, are standard choices in modern reinforcement learning frameworks, known for their efficiency in dealing with large and complex data and environments.
