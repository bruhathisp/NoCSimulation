**Overview:**

The provided algorithm represents an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to optimize the design of a Network-on-Chip (NoC) system. The system aims to achieve optimal performance in various scenarios by dynamically adjusting parameters such as latency, bandwidth, buffer sizing, and throttling.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Setup and Initialization:**
   - Define a simulator environment that models the NoC system, including CPU, IO, router, network manager, and other components.
   - Implement the `ActorCritic` class as a neural network model using PyTorch. This model takes the number of inputs and actions as parameters and consists of common layers followed by separate actor and critic branches.

2. **Training Loop:**
   - Define a training function `train` that takes the environment, model, and number of episodes as input.
   - Initialize an Adam optimizer to update the model parameters.
   - Iterate over a specified number of episodes, each representing a simulation run.
   - Within each episode:
     - Reset the environment to its initial state.
     - Perform actions in the environment while collecting experience (state, action, reward) tuples.
     - Compute the advantage, actor loss, and critic loss based on collected experiences.
     - Update the model parameters using backpropagation and optimizer step.
     - Periodically print the loss for monitoring training progress.

3. **Utility Functions:**
   - Define utility functions such as `compute_returns` to calculate discounted returns and `entropy` for entropy regularization during training.


**Import and Compatibility:**

The provided code imports `numpy` as `np` and utilizes `torch` for deep learning functionalities. Since `torch` is compatible with `numpy`, the import statement should work seamlessly without any issues. However, it's essential to ensure that both `numpy` and `torch` libraries are installed in the Python environment where the code is executed.
