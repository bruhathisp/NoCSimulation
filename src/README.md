# Each file in the `network` directory contributes to the NoC simulation:

1. `ControlModule.cc` & `ControlModule.h`: Defines a control unit that manages and coordinates activities within the network. The `.cc` file contains implementations, and the `.h` file has declarations.

2. `CPU.cc` & `CPU.h`: These define the behavior of a CPU module in the network, handling computation tasks and generating network traffic.

3. `IO.cc` & `IO.h`: Represent an I/O module in the NoC, managing input/output operations, which may include interacting with external systems or user inputs.

4. `NetworkManager.cc` & `NetworkManager.h`: Define the Network Manager, a module responsible for overseeing the entire network, possibly handling resource allocation, monitoring performance, and reporting.

5. `NoCNetwork.cc` & `NoCNetwork.h`: Contains the top-level network configuration and instantiation of the NoC, including setting up the initial state and parameters for the simulation.

6. `PowerManager.cc` & `PowerManager.h`: These files are expected to manage power-related aspects of the NoC, which can include power-gating, voltage/frequency scaling, and thermal management.

7. `Router.cc` & `Router.h`: Define the routing logic within the NoC, detailing how data packets are forwarded from one node to another.

8. `TrafficAnalyzer.cc` & `TrafficAnalyzer.h`: Implement functionality for analyzing traffic patterns within the NoC, including data collection for latency, bandwidth usage, and packet loss.

Additionally, `.ned` files like `CPU.ned`, `IO.ned`, `NoCNetwork.ned`, `Router.ned`, and `TrafficAnalyzer.ned` would be used within OMNeT++ to describe the network topology, including the placement of modules and the connections between them. 

The Makefile is a script used by the `make` build automation tool to compile and link the simulation's source files into executable form.

Finally, `package.ned` is likely to define the package structure, allowing OMNeT++ to correctly reference modules within the simulation project.

# Modules Explained in Detail


1. **CPU Module**: This module typically handles processing tasks within the network, simulating the behavior of a processor in a network-on-chip environment. It may generate traffic (data packets) to simulate workload, handle incoming messages, and possibly simulate computational processing. The CPU's activities could include generating requests or computations based on simulated applications running on the network.

2. **IO Module**: The Input/Output (IO) module is responsible for managing data transfer between the NoC system and the external environment. This can involve handling data input and output operations, simulating the interface between the NoC and system peripherals or external networks. The IO module might also be tasked with managing data buffers and directing traffic to appropriate destinations within the chip.

3. **Router Module**: Routers in a NoC are critical for directing traffic efficiently across the network. The Router module simulates the decision-making process involved in packet routing. It uses algorithms to determine the best paths for data packets based on the network's current state, such as congestion levels or distance to the destination. The router ensures that data reaches its intended destination in the most efficient manner possible.

1. **Control Module**: This module typically orchestrates and coordinates various operations within the NoC, managing control signals and possibly configuration settings that affect other modules' operation. It can initiate and monitor execution flows, making adjustments to optimize performance and responsiveness based on real-time data.

2. **Network Manager**: Responsible for overseeing the entire network's operations, this module could track network performance, handle dynamic configuration changes, and ensure network resources are optimally allocated. It might also monitor network conditions and make decisions to adjust parameters or configurations to maintain or enhance performance.

3. **Power Manager**: This module focuses on managing the power consumption and energy efficiency of the NoC. It can implement strategies for reducing power usage, such as power gating, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, or managing the operational state of various components based on current power policies or performance requirements.

4. **Traffic Analyzer**: This module analyzes the traffic flow within the network, providing insights into data packet movement, identifying bottlenecks, and measuring performance metrics like latency and throughput. It helps in understanding traffic patterns and can be used to suggest or automatically implement optimizations to improve network efficiency and performance.
