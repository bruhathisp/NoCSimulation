Each file in the `network` directory contributes to the NoC simulation:

1. `ControlModule.cc` & `ControlModule.h`: Defines a control unit that manages and coordinates activities within the network. The `.cc` file contains implementations, and the `.h` file has declarations.

2. `CPU.cc` & `CPU.h`: These define the behavior of a CPU module in the network, handling computation tasks and generating network traffic.

3. `IO.cc` & `IO.h`: Represent an I/O module in the NoC, managing input/output operations, which may include interacting with external systems or user inputs.

4. `NetworkManager.cc` & `NetworkManager.h`: Define the Network Manager, a module responsible for overseeing the entire network, possibly handling resource allocation, monitoring performance, and reporting.

5. `NoCNetwork.cc` & `NoCNetwork.h`: Contains the top-level network configuration and instantiation of the NoC, including setting up the initial state and parameters for the simulation.

6. `PowerManager.cc` & `PowerManager.h`: These files are expected to manage power-related aspects of the NoC, which can include power-gating, voltage/frequency scaling, and thermal management.

7. `Router.cc` & `Router.h`: Define the routing logic within the NoC, detailing how data packets are forwarded from one node to another.

8. `TrafficAnalyzer.cc` & `TrafficAnalyzer.h`: Implement functionality for analyzing traffic patterns within the NoC, including data collection for latency, bandwidth usage, and packet loss.

Additionally, `.ned` files like `CPU.ned`, `IO.ned`, `NoCNetwork.ned`, `Router.ned`, and `TrafficAnalyzer.ned` would be used within OMNeT++ to describe the network topology, including the placement of modules and the connections between them. 

The Makefile is a script used by the `make` build automation tool to compile and link the simulation's source files into executable form.

Finally, `package.ned` is likely to define the package structure, allowing OMNeT++ to correctly reference modules within the simulation project.
